# Waracle iOS Tech Test

Thanks for applying to Waracle! The purpose of this test is to assess your skills and understanding of the Swift programming language, iOS development and software engineering practices.

The provided Xcode project is a prototype of a simple app to display a list of cakes with thumbnail images. When a cake is selected, a detail view is shown with a large image.

Unfortunately the prototype has a number of bugs and issues, and also is not particularly well engineered! Your task is to fix and refactor the app to address these concerns, and also add a pull-to-refresh feature.

## Minimum Requirements

- Layout issues should be fixed and the UI should adapt well to different iPhone device models (donâ€™t worry about iPad!)
- UI interaction should be smooth and app should not stutter
- App should be performant and work reliably without crashing
- At least devices running iOS 14 or newer should be supported
- You should add "pull to refresh" support to the app - i.e. when the main list is pulled down, the standard iOS pull to refresh control should be shown and the JSON reloaded from the network.

## What we are looking for

In addition to the above requirements above you should:

- Improve the quality of the code / architecture
- Demonstrate good software engineering practice
- Update and fill out the file [NOTES.md](NOTES.md)

Please also:

- Use the latest non-beta version of Xcode that is available at the time of completing the test and document which version is used in NOTES.md
- Do NOT use any third party libraries, but feel free to suggest any that you might have used in your [NOTES.md](NOTES.md) file.
- Ensure the core of the app remains a UIKit app


## Submission process

- Provide your final submission as a Zip file via email, including your `.git` folder to preserve any git history
- If you fork the repository, please ensure your fork is private and not visible to other potential candidates.

You may change, rewrite, adapt and improve as much of the app as you like within the constraints above. There is no one right solution, so feel free to impress us!

There is no limit to how long you can take to complete the test, however we suggest it should take around 3 hours. We are not looking for perfection, so feel free to suggest a list of things you would add or improve if you had more time in your [NOTES.md](NOTES.md) file.
